These are all the themes i have picked up from other devs throwing them out, or made by my own.
I hope you enjoy! :)

# 3. My Fixes!!

How to import a fix?

@import url(**url here is the one you copy once you click *Here* below**); is the fixes url. DO NOT REPLACE ANY URLS IN THE FILE, INSTEAD PASTE IT BELOW THE ORIGINAL ONE(S). The second URL is NOT a replacement as it is just fixes!

(for example `@import url('https://xcruxiex.github.io/BBDThemes/Fixes/NeutronFixes.css');` <- this is what it would look like 'in-file')

## Neutron Fixes

Import Link : [HERE](https://xcruxiex.github.io/BBDThemes/Fixes/NeutronFixes.css)

## Nocturnal Fixes

**Disclaimer:** It's to my knowledge that this import was implemented into the base code (so no need to import it yourself).

Import Link : [HERE](https://xcruxiex.github.io/BBDThemes/Fixes/NocturnalFixes.css)
