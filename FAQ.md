## How do i change *variable here*?
All themes are provided with images & color, but you can easily customize your theme.

1. Open the theme file:
   * Go to discord settings page.
   * Go to themes.
   * Click on "open themes folder".
   * Open the theme file with any text editor (notepadd++, atom, vscode, etc...).
2. Find the ":root" part, this is where all color and images are defined.
3. Change values to your liking:
   * For images, replace the link, must be a direct link (ie. www.website.com/example-img.png) (you can use .png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif).
   * For colors, replace the color code, you can use [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) to get color codes.
